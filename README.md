- **Gallery System**: Manage images with titles, captions, descriptions, tags; link images to entities; upload via drag-and-drop or file picker; use images as profile pictures for entities

## Data Structure

All data is stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter. By default (multi-story):

- Characters: `StorytellerSuite/Stories/[StoryName]/Characters/`
- Locations: `StorytellerSuite/Stories/[StoryName]/Locations/`
- Events: `StorytellerSuite/Stories/[StoryName]/Events/`
- Items: `StorytellerSuite/Stories/[StoryName]/Items/`
- References: `StorytellerSuite/Stories/[StoryName]/References/`
- Chapters: `StorytellerSuite/Stories/[StoryName]/Chapters/`
- Scenes: `StorytellerSuite/Stories/[StoryName]/Scenes/`
- Images: User-defined upload folder (default `StorytellerSuite/GalleryUploads`)

You can customize this behavior in Settings → Storyteller Suite:

- Enable “Use custom entity folders” to specify your own folders for characters, locations, events, items, references, chapters, and scenes (no automatic story nesting).
- Enable “One Story Mode” to flatten the structure under a single base folder (default `StorytellerSuite`):
  - Characters: `[Base]/Characters/`
  - Locations: `[Base]/Locations/`
  - Events: `[Base]/Events/`
  - Items: `[Base]/Items/`
  - References: `[Base]/References/`
  - Chapters: `[Base]/Chapters/`
  - Scenes: `[Base]/Scenes/`

Note: In One Story Mode, the dashboard’s “New story” button is hidden for consistency. In normal mode, multi-story management works as before.
